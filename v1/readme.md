# Version V1
## Introduction
This is the first version of the hack and the purpose is to measure the distance between the floor anmd the bottom of the desk.
I'll use a simple webmos d1 with a little screen.

Following the components list
- ESP32 Wroom - Developer board
- HC-SR04 - Distance sensor
- Heltec 0.96" Oled Display


## Code
- [Here](https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/heltec0.96OLED) example code to manage the display
- [WifiConfig](https://github.com/drmpf/ESPAutoWiFiConfig) - for wifi manager and configuration without fixed data into the code
